# What is Umbrella?

Umbrella is a simple library that injects the capability of create a `DataTable` from an `IEnumerable` where its columns are pulled from a **C# projection**.
This saves you the time of write non enjoyable lines of codes for create the DataTable's columns and loop over an `IEnumerable` in order to fill the DataTable itself.

## Installation

## Usage

Just import the `Umbrella` namespace in your class, and wherever you have an instance of an `IEnumerable`, you would be able to convert it as a `DataTable`.

````csharp
using Umbrella;

...

List<Order> orders = GetOrders();

DataTable ordersTable = orders.ToDataTable(o => new {ID = o.Id, NetAmount = o.Amount + o.Freight, p.IsShipped});
````

The code snippet above would create a DataTable where its columns are `ID`, `NetAmount`, and `IsShipped`. Notice the sum operation in the `NetAmount` property: the values listed over the column would be the actual sum of both properties.

### How it works?

**Umbrella** takes help from the **Expression Tree** generated by the **.NET compiler** that represents the given **projection** in order to discover the columns and values that would compound the `DataTable`s columns and rows respectively.
